* transform.by renamed to transformBy
* new function uptade_img.path

Version 1.1-8
* EBImage and hopach were 'suggested' but used unconditionally in some examples
* vignettes PDFs size was reduced by using png figures when suited
* More informative error messages in load.cellID.data
* transform does not add variables to as.factor
* solved bug in cimage time.var argument
* merge.cell.data gains add and warn arguments
* optimized update.n.tot
* several chanches to cimage, hopefully more intuitive behaviour
* compatibility with ggplot2 version 0.9.0

Version 1.1-7

* New function append.oif.time
* Bug fix of map.cells.points, probably introduced in version 1.0-7

Version 1.0-7
